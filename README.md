📊 Healthcare Datasets Dashboard

A Power BI–based analytical dashboard designed to explore, clean, and visualize Healthcare datasets. This project helps users uncover insights into patient demographics, billing patterns, hospital performance, and other operational metrics.

📝 Project Description

This project aims to transform raw healthcare datasets into a refined, interactive Power BI dashboard.
The dashboard enables hospitals and healthcare managers to monitor trends, identify bottlenecks, and improve overall patient and financial outcomes.

🧰 Tech Stack
- Power BI – Data modeling, transformation, and interactive visual design
- Power Query (M Language) – ETL operations
- DAX – Calculated measures & KPIs
- Excel / CSV – Source data formatting


📂 Data Source
- Kaggle Healthcare Dataset
  (Cleaned and transformed before loading into Power BI)

✨ Features & Highlights
Hospitals generate large amounts of operational data, but lack centralized analytics to understand:
- Patient demographic trends
- Billing and revenue performance
- Seasonal or department-wise demand
- Average length of stay and service quality
- High-level KPIs for decision making

🎯 Goal of the Dashboard
- To create a unified analytics layer for healthcare operations
- To track performance across multiple KPIs
- To reveal hidden trends for better planning & resource optimization
